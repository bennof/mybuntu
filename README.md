# Mybuntu

## About
Mybunutu is a Makefile collection to setup ubuntu, debian 
and raspbian distributions. Depending on selected software
additional functions are included. `make help` is missing 
in many cases. 
The software selection is my personal flavour and is no general 
setup. My personal favourites are nginx and erlang based 
software. For further information read packages section.

## Makefile
Why make and no modern fancy tools or simple bash? Make is
installed by default or just `sudo apt-get install make`. 
Bash is a powerful scripting language, which can handle
all the stuff, but I like to use dash. Bash can execute dash 
or sh scripts but is complicated to handle build targets.
